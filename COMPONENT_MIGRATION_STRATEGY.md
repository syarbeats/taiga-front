# Component Migration Strategy

## Analysis Criteria
Our component analysis script will help us prioritize migration by examining:

1. **Complexity Metrics**
   - Lines of code
   - Number of dependencies
   - Template complexity
   - State management complexity

2. **Dependency Chain**
   - Standalone vs. dependent components
   - Shared service dependencies
   - Parent-child relationships

3. **Usage Patterns**
   - Frequency of use across the application
   - Critical path components
   - Shared/reusable components

## Migration Priority Categories

### 1. Low-Hanging Fruit (Phase 1)
- Standalone components with few dependencies
- Simple UI components (presentational)
- Components with minimal state management
- Non-critical path components

### 2. Shared Components (Phase 2)
- Reusable UI components
- Form components
- Dialog/Modal components
- Navigation components

### 3. Feature Components (Phase 3)
- Business logic heavy components
- Components with complex state
- Components with multiple dependencies
- Components using AngularJS services

### 4. Core Components (Phase 4)
- Root level components
- Layout components
- Authentication components
- Core service integrations

## Migration Process Per Component

1. **Analysis Phase**
   ```
   - Review component dependencies
   - Identify state management patterns
   - Document API interactions
   - Map event handlers
   ```

2. **React Implementation**
   ```
   - Create component shell
   - Implement state management
   - Port template to JSX
   - Migrate event handlers
   - Add TypeScript types
   ```

3. **Testing**
   ```
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Visual regression tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   ```

4. **Integration**
   ```
   - Bridge with AngularJS
   - State synchronization
   - Event handling
   - Route integration
   ```

## Component Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Run component analysis
- [ ] Document dependencies
- [ ] Create test cases
- [ ] Plan state management approach

### During Migration
- [ ] Create React component
- [ ] Implement tests
- [ ] Setup bridge layer if needed
- [ ] Verify functionality
- [ ] Performance testing

### Post-Migration
- [ ] Remove AngularJS component
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Clean up dependencies
- [ ] Remove bridge code

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**
   - Feature parity
   - No regression bugs
   - All tests passing

2. **Performance**
   - Equal or better render times
   - Reduced bundle size
   - Improved memory usage

3. **Code Quality**
   - TypeScript coverage
   - Test coverage
   - Consistent patterns
   - Modern React practices

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Maintain feature flags
   - Implement rollback capability
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Regular testing cycles

2. **Business Risks**
   - Gradual component migration
   - Critical path testing
   - User feedback collection
   - Performance monitoring

This strategy ensures a methodical, risk-aware approach to migrating components from AngularJS to React, prioritizing stability and maintainability throughout the process.
